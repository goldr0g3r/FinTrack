## System Architecture

### Overview
The Expense Tracker SaaS application is designed to provide users with a comprehensive tool for managing their finances. The system architecture is divided into three main components: the **backend**, the **mobile application**, and **third-party integrations**.

### Backend (NestJS)
The backend is built using **NestJS**, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. The backend will handle the following responsibilities:

1. **API Endpoints**: Expose RESTful APIs for the Flutter app to interact with.
2. **Database Management**: Store and manage user data, transactions, and financial goals.
3. **AI-Powered Financial Suggestions**: Integrate machine learning models to analyze user data and provide financial insights.
4. **SMS Parsing**: Process SMS notifications to automatically log transactions.
5. **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure user data and ensure only authorized access.

#### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database for storing structured data like users, transactions, and financial goals.
- **Redis**: For caching frequently accessed data (e.g., user sessions, financial insights).

#### Third-Party Integrations
1. **SMS Reading**: Use platform-specific APIs (e.g., Android's `SmsManager`) to read SMS notifications and send them to the backend for parsing.
2. **Notification Services**: Integrate with **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for push notifications.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Utilize third-party ML services (e.g., TensorFlow, AWS SageMaker) or custom models for financial suggestions.

### Mobile Application (Flutter)
The mobile application is built using **Flutter**, a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. The Flutter app will:

1. **User Interface**: Provide a user-friendly dashboard with visualizations like pie charts, graphs, and trends.
2. **API Communication**: Interact with the NestJS backend to fetch and send data.
3. **Local Storage**: Cache data for offline access and improve performance.
4. **Push Notifications**: Notify users about important financial updates or reminders.

## Machine Learning Models

### Model Types
1. **Classification Models**: Categorize transactions into different spending categories.
2. **Regression Models**: Predict future spending based on historical data.
3. **Clustering Models**: Identify spending patterns and anomalies.

### Data Pipeline
1. **Data Collection**: Collect user transactions and spending data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize the data.
3. **Model Training**: Train models using historical data.
4. **Model Deployment**: Deploy models to a cloud service (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform).
5. **Integration**: Integrate the models with the NestJS backend to provide real-time suggestions.

### Integration Points
- **Transaction Analysis**: Analyze transactions to provide spending insights.
- **Goal Tracking**: Predict progress towards financial goals.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual spending patterns.

## Security and Scalability

### Security
1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
2. **Authentication**: Use JWT tokens for secure authentication.
3. **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
5. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

### Scalability
1. **Load Balancing**: Use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across servers.
2. **Database Sharding**: Shard the database to handle large volumes of data.
3. **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load.
4. **Microservices**: Consider breaking down the backend into microservices for better scalability.

## Additional Features and Best Practices

### Features
1. **Multi-Currency Support**: Allow users to track expenses in multiple currencies.
2. **Recurring Transactions**: Automatically log recurring transactions (e.g., subscriptions).
3. **Export Data**: Enable users to export their financial data to CSV or PDF.
4. **Budgeting Tools**: Provide tools for creating and managing budgets.

### Best Practices
1. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the Flutter app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
2. **User Feedback**: Collect and act on user feedback to continuously improve the app.
3. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for both the backend and mobile app.
4. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
